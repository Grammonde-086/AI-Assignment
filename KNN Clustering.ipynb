    "### K Nearest Neighbor\n",
    "KNN can be used for both classification and regression predictive problems. However, it is more widely used in classification problems in the industry. To evaluate any technique we generally look at 3 important aspects:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>Ease to interpret output</li>\n",
    "    <li>Calculation time</li>\n",
    "    <li>Predictive Power</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How does it work?\n",
    "Following is a spread of red circles (RC) and green squares (GS) :\n",
    "<img src=\"https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/scenario1.png\">\n",
    "You intend to find out the class of the blue star (BS). BS can either be RC or GS and nothing else. The “K” is KNN algorithm is the nearest neighbor we wish to take the vote from. Let’s say K = 3. Hence, we will now make a circle with BS as the center just as big as to enclose only three datapoints on the plane. Refer to the following diagram for more details:\n",
    "<img src=\"https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/scenario2.png\">\n",
    "The three closest points to BS is all RC. Hence, with a good confidence level, we can say that the BS should belong to the class RC.\n",
    "#### How do we choose K?\n",
    "The following are the different boundaries separating the two classes with different values of K. If you watch carefully, you can see that the boundary becomes smoother with increasing value of K. With K increasing to infinity it finally becomes all blue or all red depending on the total majority.\n",
    "To get the optimal value of K, you can segregate the training and validation from the initial dataset."
